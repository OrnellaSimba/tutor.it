What do Ikea, a GPS device and a your Tax declaration have in common ?

They are complicated, need a strict set of instructions 
->  A step by step guide.

Until today, to solve this, Humanity has created the dreaded ... User Manual.

And user manuals are a pain: they are complex, and often inadapted to many people and context.

## no Titcher
Meet Kevin, and his dad: Jean-Pierre. 	(both wave at the audience) ..
They bought this great Klingollax wardrobe for Kevin’s new flat. 
									(Slide : rotating video of the wardrobe, or screen capture of the ikea website product page) 
This is them opening the box. 			(both smiling, expecting to have their wardrobe up and standing in a few minutes.) 

This is them after a few hours 			(kev+dad exhausted and desperate) . 
They lost a screw and have 3 parts leftover.
And this is the wardrobe (completely fucked up) 

What if we could improve this user experience using a slightly artificial intelligence ?

Meet our Teacher — TUFUMA — : The User Friendly User Manual Assistant. (or UFUMA or UFUM or FUMA or FUM) FUM turns Manuals into Interactive Tutorials, that users can control via the voice. Because their hands are busy...
